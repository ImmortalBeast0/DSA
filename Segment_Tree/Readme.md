Segment Tree – CSES Problem Solution

This repository contains my implementation of a Segment Tree solution for one of the CSES Range Query problems.
The goal is to practice clean implementation of segment trees and improve my understanding of range-query data structures.

Feel free to check the code and suggest improvements.
Any feedback on logic, structure, or optimizations is welcome.
