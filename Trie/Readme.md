I’ve added two files related to the Trie data structure:

1.LeetCode Problem Solution – my implementation of the Trie for a specific LeetCode problem.
(https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=trie).
2.Custom Trie Implementation – a simple standalone implementation to understand the core logic clearly.

These files are added to practice and improve my understanding of Trie operations.
Feel free to check the code and share any suggestions or improvements.
